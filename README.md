# CLI Chess Minigame

CLI Chess Minigame is a simple CLI that allows users to login, view the hi-score chart of everyone that beat the computer, and play chess games against the computer.

## Installation

Fork this repo, copy the SSH link, and type "git clone 'SSH link'" into your terminal in your desired directory.

## Usage

The CLI Chess Minigame allows a user to create an account and easily go through the hi-scores of every player that beat the computer in a chess game. The hi-score chart is organized from least number of moves at the top and most and the bottom. Once logged in, a user can start a new chess game against the computer. Moves are communicated tot eh program using standard chess notation and if you enter 'h', the user can get a help section that explains how to properly use chess notation.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Roadmap

I plan on eventually adding the capability for the computer to change difficulty. 

Also I am planning on adding the capability for the user to be a color other than white.

Additionally, I plan on adding the ability for a user to select a game from the hi-score chart (using the game id) to look at the final board state of that game.
